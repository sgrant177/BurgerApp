# Burger Devourer

## Description
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## Installation
copy the repo to your local machine from the girhub repository.

## Usage
npm install node, express, and express-handlebars. Then, run the server.js file from the console.
